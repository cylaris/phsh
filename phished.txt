Whoops!

The link you just clicked on was a phish! - But don't worry, this was a demonstration.

However, if this had been real there could have been risk of a real attack. Like a drive-by compromise, or credential theft.

Please only click links and follow instruction from people that you know, and make sure you are expecting this content from that person (because they could've been hacked or spoofed!).
